            Creates a DisasterDict that stores each file path.

            This function loads file paths from a given directory structure and a JSON file.
            It verifies the existence of the paths, reads the JSON file to get the splits,
            and then organizes the file paths into a nested dictionary.

            Args:
                sliced_path (str): Path to the directory containing the sliced data.
                split_json_path (str): Path to the JSON file that contains the data splits.

            Returns:
                dict: A nested dictionary (DisasterDict) where each key represents a subset
                    (train, val, test) and contains the file paths organized by patch and file type.
